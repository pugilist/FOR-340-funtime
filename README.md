## About
This repo holds some software that I developed while taking forensics 320 (Operating System Forensics) at Champlain College.  Some code in here is over-engineered for the purposes of practicing sofware development, while some other code is very minimalist.

This software may produce inaccurate data or results, trust it at your own risk :)
